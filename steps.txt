After you have the "When an HTTP request is received" trigger, add a "Compose" action from the "Data Operations" actions.

In the "Inputs" of the "Compose" action, use the expression @contains(triggerOutputs()?['queries'], 'validationToken'). This expression checks if the validationToken is present in the incoming request.

Then, add a "Condition" control. For the condition, choose the output of the "Compose" action, and check if it equals true.

If the condition is true, this means the validationToken is present. Then, you should respond with a 200 OK response where the body is the validationToken. Add a "Response" action in the "If true" part of the condition. Set the Status Code to 200, and for the Body, use the expression @triggerOutputs()?['queries']['validationToken'].

In the "If false" part of the condition, you can handle actual notifications about new call records. For now, you can leave this part empty or just add a placeholder action.
